## 📖 Overview

This repository contains all the material needed to build and deploy a web application for lung segmentation in thoracic X-ray (CXR) images. The goal of the project is to upload a .png X-ray image and obtain the corresponding predicted lung mask using a U-Net model trained with MONAI. This project is part of the **Advanced Topics in Machine Learning and Neural Networks** course.

This repo includes:
- Lung Segmentation.pdf, a short overview of what you will do
- Lung Segmentatio Notebook, a notebook to be run in Kaggle, in order to implement your own segmentation model.
